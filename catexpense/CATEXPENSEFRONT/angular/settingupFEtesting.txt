Installing Dependencies:

after pulling, go to the /CATEXPENSE/angular folder in the command line and type 
> npm install
This will install the dependencies required into a folder called node_modules
This is only done once, unless there is a need for more dependencies to be added in the future.


Running Tests:

In the command line, within /CATEXPENSE/angular, type
> grunt karma
This will run the tests (as of this point there are only 2 tests).

Viewing Code Coverage:

Assuming all tests pass, a code coverage report will be generated inside of /CATEXPENSEFRONT/angular/test/coverage/PhantomJs
To view the coverage, open up the index.html file in a web browser.
